**DECISION TO PROCEED WITH LITIGATION**

After careful consideration and consultation with legal counsel, I have decided to pursue this matter in federal court rather than allow content restoration under 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2)(C).

**Reasons for Legal Action:**

1. **Strong Merit**: I have strong evidence of copyright ownership and infringement
2. **No Authorization**: The counter-notice's claim of authorization is false
3. **Not Fair Use**: The use does not qualify as fair use under any analysis
4. **Willful Infringement**: Evidence suggests knowing and willful infringement
5. **Substantial Damages**: I have suffered quantifiable harm
6. **Pattern of Behavior**: This is part of pattern of infringing conduct by defendant
7. **Other**: {{additional_reasons}}

✓ It is fixed in a tangible medium
✓ It does NOT consist solely of:
  - Uncopyrightable facts or ideas
  - Functional elements
  - Short phrases or slogans (unless part of larger work)
  - Public domain material
  - U.S. government works

Copyrightability Justification:
{{copyrightability_explanation}}

**B. Fair Use Consideration**

I have evaluated whether the reported uses constitute fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107:

**Factor 1 - Purpose and Character:**
The infringing use is: {{purpose_assessment}}
- [ ] Not transformative - merely reproduces my work
- [ ] Commercial or promotional in nature
- [ ] Does not add new expression or meaning

Analysis: {{purpose_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{purpose_conclusion}}

**Factor 2 - Nature of the Work:**
My work is: {{nature_assessment}}
- [ ] Highly creative (photos, art, videos, etc.)
- [ ] Published to limited audience
- [ ] Deserving strong copyright protection

Analysis: {{nature_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{nature_conclusion}}

**Factor 3 - Amount Used:**
The posts use: {{amount_assessment}}
- [ ] My entire work, not excerpts
- [ ] Substantial and material portions
- [ ] More than necessary for any claimed purpose

Analysis: {{amount_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{amount_conclusion}}

**Factor 4 - Market Effect:**
The unauthorized use: {{market_assessment}}
- [ ] Substitutes for my original posting
- [ ] Reduces engagement on my account
- [ ] Harms my ability to monetize my content
- [ ] Causes confusion about source/origin

Analysis: {{market_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{market_conclusion}}

**OVERALL FAIR USE DETERMINATION:**
After analyzing all four statutory fair use factors, I have determined in good faith that the reported uses do NOT constitute fair use.

Reasoning: {{fair_use_summary}}

**SECTION 10: NOT JUST ATTRIBUTION ISSUE**

- [ ] This is NOT merely about lack of attribution/credit
- [ ] I did not authorize this use even with proper credit
- [ ] The use is unauthorized regardless of attribution
- [ ] This is copyright infringement, not just credit issue

If attribution was provided, would that resolve this?
- [ ] No - I want content removed regardless
- [ ] Yes - proper credit/link would be acceptable

**SECTION 11: REQUIRED LEGAL STATEMENTS**

**Good Faith Belief:**
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material described above in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
