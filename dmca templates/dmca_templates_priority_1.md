**DECISION REGARDING LEGAL ACTION:**

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2)(C), I must inform you whether I intend to file a lawsuit against the counter-notice filer.

[ ] OPTION 1: I WILL FILE LAWSUIT

Case Number: {{lawsuit_case_number}} (if already filed)
Expected Filing Date: {{expected_filing_date}} (if not yet filed)

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(g)(2)(C), I request that {{platform_name}} NOT restore the removed content pending resolution of this legal action. I will provide proof of lawsuit filing within 14 days.

[ ] OPTION 2: I WILL NOT FILE LAWSUIT (Content May Be Restored)

After reviewing the counter-notice and considering the costs and likelihood of success in federal litigation, I have decided NOT to file a lawsuit at this time.

2. I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on their behalf
3. The counter-notice claims are without merit based on {{reasons}}
4. [If filing lawsuit] I have filed or will file a lawsuit within the timeframe required by law
