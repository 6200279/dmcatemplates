**SECTION 6: WHAT USER NEEDS TO DO**

**Remediation Instructions:**

To remedy this infringement, the repository owner must:

**Option A - Deletion:**
- [ ] Delete the entire repository
- [ ] Delete specific files: {{files_to_delete}}
- [ ] Delete specific directories: {{directories_to_delete}}

**Option B - Attribution:**
- [ ] Add proper attribution to: {{attribution_details}}
- [ ] Add license file: {{required_license}}
- [ ] Acknowledge source: {{acknowledgment_text}}

**Option C - License Compliance:**
- [ ] Comply with license terms: {{license_terms}}

- [ ] Release changes under: {{required_license_type}}

**Option D - Specific Changes:**
- [ ] Remove proprietary code in: {{specific_removals}}
- [ ] Replace with: {{replacement_instructions}}

**SECTION 7: PRE-FILING ASSESSMENT**

**A. Copyrightability Assessment**

I have verified my code/content is protected by copyright:

✓ Original expression in code
✓ Fixed in tangible form (source files, commits)
✓ Not consisting solely of unprotectable elements

**Specific Copyrightability:**
- [ ] Original code implementation (not just algorithms/ideas)
- [ ] Creative expression in code structure/organization
- [ ] Original comments/documentation
- [ ] Original configuration/setup
- [ ] Compilation/selection of components
- [ ] Original training data/datasets (if applicable)

**Not Claiming Copyright In:**
- [ ] Programming language syntax (unprotectable)
- [ ] General algorithms or methods (ideas)
- [ ] Standard libraries or frameworks
- [ ] Public domain code
- [ ] Code under permissive licenses (that user violated)

What IS copyrightable: {{copyrightable_code_elements}}

Justification: {{copyrightability_explanation}}

**B. Fair Use Analysis - Code Context**

I have carefully considered whether this use constitutes fair use, especially given GitHub's role in open source and collaborative development:

**Factor 1 - Purpose and Character:**

Is the use transformative or merely reproductory?
- [ ] No - direct copy/fork of my proprietary code
- [ ] No - removes my attribution/license
- [ ] No - commercial use of my proprietary work
- [ ] Violates my license terms (even if license permits some use)

GitHub/open source considerations:
- [ ] This is NOT open source software available for public use
- [ ] My code was never released under permissive license
- [ ] User violated the terms of my license (GPL, MIT, etc.)
- [ ] No transformative purpose - just using my code as-is

Analysis: {{purpose_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{purpose_conclusion}}

**Factor 2 - Nature of Work:**
My code is:
- [ ] Proprietary commercial software
- [ ] Unpublished private code (leaked/stolen)
- [ ] Creative implementation with original expression
- [ ] Confidential trade secret material
- [ ] Published but with restrictive license

Analysis: {{nature_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{nature_conclusion}}

**Factor 3 - Amount Used:**
The repository uses:
- [ ] My entire codebase
- [ ] Substantial core components
- [ ] Heart of my implementation
- [ ] Not excerpts - complete files/modules
- Percentage of my code used: {{percentage_used}}%

Analysis: {{amount_analysis}}

Educational/reference use consideration:
- Could they have used smaller snippets for legitimate learning?
- Do they need entire codebase or would excerpts suffice?
- Are they redistributing beyond fair educational use?

Conclusion: {{amount_conclusion}}

**Factor 4 - Market Effect:**
This repository:
- [ ] Directly competes with my commercial product
- [ ] Enables others to avoid purchasing my software
- [ ] Undermines my licensing model
- [ ] Harms potential licensing opportunities
- [ ] Exposes proprietary implementation details
- Economic impact: {{economic_impact}}

GitHub-specific market harm:
- Public repository enables unlimited redistribution
- Forks multiply the distribution exponentially
- Undermines value of my proprietary work

Analysis: {{market_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{market_conclusion}}

**OVERALL FAIR USE DETERMINATION:**

After evaluating all four factors in the context of GitHub's collaborative development platform, I have determined in good faith that this does NOT constitute fair use.

**Key Reasons:**
1. Not transformative - direct copy of proprietary code
2. Uses substantial/complete portions of my work
3. Direct market harm and competitive injury
4. Violates my license terms (if applicable)
5. Not legitimate educational/reference use

**SECTION 8: LICENSE VIOLATION vs. COPYRIGHT**

**If code was released under a license:**

My code is licensed under: {{my_license}}
- [ ] GPL (requires derivative works be open sourced)
- [ ] MIT (requires attribution)
- [ ] Apache (requires notices)
- [ ] Proprietary/Commercial license
- [ ] Other: {{other_license}}

**License Violations:**
The repository violates my license by:
- [ ] Removing copyright notices/attribution
- [ ] Not providing source code (if copyleft license)
- [ ] Using commercially without permission
- [ ] Not including required license file
- [ ] Violating other terms: {{license_violations}}

**Important Note:**
- [ ] This is BOTH a copyright claim AND license violation
- [ ] License violation supports copyright claim
- [ ] Even permissive licenses require compliance

**If code was NOT licensed for public use:**
- [ ] My code is proprietary and was never publicly released
- [ ] Code was stolen/leaked without authorization
- [ ] No license was ever granted

**SECTION 9: GITHUB POLICY COMPLIANCE**

**Public Disclosure Consent:**
I understand that:
- [ ] GitHub publishes all DMCA notices at github.com/github/dmca
- [ ] Personal information will be redacted
- [ ] Repository URLs and technical details will be public
- [ ] This notice becomes part of public record

I consent to this public disclosure.

**Takedown Process Understanding:**
I understand GitHub's process:
- [ ] ~1 business day given for user to make changes
- [ ] If changes not made, repository disabled
- [ ] User can file counter-notice
- [ ] If counter-notice filed, I have 10-14 days to file suit

**SECTION 8: PRE-FILING ASSESSMENT**

**A. Copyrightability**

✓ Original creative work
✓ Fixed in tangible digital form
✓ Protected by copyright

NFT-specific considerations:
- My copyright covers the artwork/content
- NFT ownership ≠ copyright ownership
- Unauthorized minting violates my exclusive rights
- Token metadata references my copyrighted work

**B. Fair Use Analysis**

**Factor 1 - Purpose:**
NFT minting is:
- [ ] Commercial sale for profit
- [ ] Not transformative - exact copy
- [ ] No commentary or criticism
- [ ] Purpose: profit from my work

Conclusion: Commercial exploitation, not fair use.

**Factor 2 - Nature:**
- Creative digital artwork with strong protection
- My original artistic expression

**Factor 3 - Amount:**
- Complete work used as NFT
- Not excerpts or portions

**Factor 4 - Market Effect:**
- Directly competes with my NFT sales
- Confuses buyers about authenticity
- Undermines my NFT market
- Causes economic harm

**DETERMINATION:**
NOT fair use - unauthorized commercial exploitation via NFT minting.

**SECTION 9: BLOCKCHAIN IMMUTABILITY**

I understand that:
- [ ] Blockchain records are immutable
- [ ] NFT cannot be "deleted" from blockchain
- [ ] Marketplace can delist/hide NFT from platform
- [ ] Smart contract may remain on-chain

I request marketplace delisting and account action.

**SECTION 10: REQUIRED STATEMENTS**

I have a good faith belief that the NFT minting and sale of my copyrighted work is not authorized by me, my agent, or the law.

**Accuracy:**
This information is accurate.

**Perjury:**
Under penalty of perjury, I am the copyright owner or authorized agent.
