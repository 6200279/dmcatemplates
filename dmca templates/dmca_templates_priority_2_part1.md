**SECTION 3: COPYRIGHTED WORKS (REPRESENTATIVE LIST)**

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(ii), which permits a "representative list" when multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are infringed, I provide the following representative examples:

Work 1:

- Copyright Date: {{work_3_date}}
- Infringing URLs: {{work_3_infringing_urls}}

[Continue for representative works...]

**REPRESENTATIVE LIST JUSTIFICATION:**

This representative list is provided because:
- All infringements are located on the same site: {{site_domain}}
- The infringing works follow the same pattern: {{pattern}}
- The total number of infringements ({{total_count}}) makes individual listing impractical
- These representative examples demonstrate the nature and scope of infringement

**SECTION 4: COMPLETE URL LIST**

Complete list of all {{total_count}} infringing URLs:

{{bulk_url_list}}

(See attached spreadsheet/CSV for full structured data)

- Total Uploads: {{total_uploads}}
- Percentage of Uploads That Infringe: {{infringement_percentage}}%
- Evidence of Commercial Motive: {{commercial_evidence}}
- Previous DMCA Notices Against This Source: {{previous_notices}}

**SECTION 6: PRE-FILING BULK ASSESSMENT**

For each representative work, I have assessed:

**Copyrightability (Bulk):** All works listed are original creative works protected by copyright, not consisting of unprotectable elements.

**Fair Use Analysis (Pattern):** I have evaluated the systematic pattern of use:
- Purpose: {{bulk_fair_use_purpose}} (typically: verbatim reproduction for commercial gain)
- Nature: {{bulk_fair_use_nature}} (creative works)
- Amount: {{bulk_fair_use_amount}} (complete copies)
- Market Effect: {{bulk_fair_use_market}} (direct market substitution)

CONCLUSION: The pattern demonstrates wholesale copyright piracy, not fair use.

**SECTION 7: REQUIRED LEGAL STATEMENTS**

Good Faith Belief: I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Accuracy: The information in this notification is accurate.

Authorization Under Penalty of Perjury: Under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of exclusive rights that are allegedly infringed.

**SECTION 8: REQUESTED ACTIONS**

Due to the systematic nature of this infringement, I request:

1. ✓ Removal of all {{total_count}} identified infringing items
2. ✓ Account suspension or termination for repeat infringer
3. ✓ Implementation of upload filters to prevent re-upload
4. ✓ Disclosure of account holder information (if legally permissible)
5. ✓ Hash-based blocking of removed content
6. ✓ Monitoring for re-uploads from same source

**SECTION 9: REPEAT INFRINGER POLICY**

I note that under 17 U.S.C. § 512(i)(1)(A), service providers must have a policy for terminating repeat infringers to maintain safe harbor protection.

Previous notices against this account/source:
{{previous_notice_list}}

This bulk infringement demonstrates repeat infringer status warranting account termination.

**LEGAL BASIS FOR ESCALATION**

17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(A)(i): Service providers must lack actual knowledge of infringement to qualify for safe harbor. Your receipt of my notices provides actual knowledge.

17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(A)(iii): Service providers must act expeditiously to remove infringing content upon obtaining knowledge.

17 U.S.C. § 512(i)(1)(A): Service providers must have a policy for terminating repeat infringers.

- Notice 1: {{previous_notice_1_date}}

This demonstrates repeat infringer status warranting account termination per your policy.
