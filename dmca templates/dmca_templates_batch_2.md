- [ ] Multiple posts contain my copyrighted material
- [ ] Creator is monetizing access to my content

- My estimated patron loss: {{estimated_loss}}
- Infringer's subscriber count: {{infringer_subs}} (if visible)

- [ ] Using my name: {{name_used}}
- [ ] Using my photos/avatar: {{avatar_description}}
- [ ] Claiming to be me or affiliated with me
- [ ] Redirecting my supporters to their page

**SECTION 7: PRE-FILING ASSESSMENT**

**A. Copyrightability Assessment**

My content is protected by copyright:

✓ Original creative work created by me
✓ Fixed in tangible medium (digital files)
✓ Not consisting solely of:
  - Unprotectable facts or ideas
  - Public domain material
  - Content I don't own rights to

**Specific Copyrightability for Patreon Content:**
- [ ] Original photography I created
- [ ] Original videos I produced
- [ ] Original written content I authored
- [ ] Original artwork/illustrations I created
- [ ] Original audio/music I composed or performed
- [ ] Compilation/selection I curated for patrons

Justification: {{copyrightability_explanation}}

**B. Fair Use Analysis**

I have evaluated potential fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107:

**Factor 1 - Purpose and Character:**

The infringing Patreon page uses my content for:
{{purpose_assessment}}

- [ ] Not transformative - direct reproduction for subscribers
- [ ] Commercial purpose - charging patrons for access to my content
- [ ] No commentary, criticism, or new expression added
- [ ] Direct substitution for my own Patreon offerings

Analysis: {{purpose_analysis}}
Conclusion: This is commercial piracy, not transformative use. {{purpose_conclusion}}

**Factor 2 - Nature of Work:**

My content is:
- [ ] Creative work deserving strong protection
- [ ] Exclusive content created for paying supporters
- [ ] Personal/private content not intended for public distribution
- [ ] Professional creative work that is my livelihood

Analysis: {{nature_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{nature_conclusion}}

**Factor 3 - Amount Used:**

The infringing page uses:
- [ ] My complete works in their entirety
- [ ] Full resolution/quality versions
- [ ] Multiple works ({{work_count}} pieces)
- [ ] Not excerpts or portions - complete files

Analysis: {{amount_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{amount_conclusion}}

**Factor 4 - Market Effect:**

Impact on my Patreon business:
- [ ] Direct economic harm - subscribers going to infringer instead
- [ ] Undermines my exclusive content model
- [ ] Reduces incentive to subscribe to my Patreon
- [ ] Lost income of approximately: {{estimated_losses}}
- [ ] Destroys value of Patreon exclusivity

Analysis: {{market_analysis}}
Conclusion: This directly competes with and harms my Patreon income. {{market_conclusion}}

**OVERALL FAIR USE DETERMINATION:**

After evaluating all four factors, I have determined in good faith that this use does NOT constitute fair use. This is unauthorized commercial redistribution of my exclusive content that directly harms my creator business.

**Key Reasons:**
1. Commercial exploitation without transformation
2. Uses my complete works
3. Direct market substitution and economic harm
4. Undermines my exclusive content model

**SECTION 8: PATREON POLICY VIOLATIONS**

This also violates Patreon's:
- [ ] Community Guidelines - Respect Creative Works
- [ ] Terms of Use regarding intellectual property
- [ ] Creator policies against sharing others' patron content
- [ ] Policies against impersonation (if applicable)
- [ ] Policies against misleading patrons

**SECTION 9: REQUIRED LEGAL STATEMENTS**

**Good Faith Belief:**
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

**Accuracy Declaration:**

**Authorization Under Penalty of Perjury:**
Under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I request that Patreon:

1. ✓ Remove all infringing posts from the reported creator's page
2. ✓ Suspend or terminate the infringing creator's account
3. ✓ Refund patrons who paid for access to my stolen content
4. ✓ Provide me with infringing creator's contact information (if legally permissible)
5. ✓ Implement filters to prevent re-upload of my content
6. ✓ Apply Patreon's repeat infringer policy
7. ✓ Confirm removal and actions taken

**For Systematic Infringement:**
- [ ] Permanent account termination recommended
- [ ] This creator has no legitimate content - entire page is leaked material
- [ ] Payouts should be frozen and potentially returned to victims

- [ ] I am a verified Patreon creator: {{my_patreon_url}}

{{strike_justification}}

**SECTION 7: PRE-FILING ASSESSMENT**

**A. Copyrightability Assessment**

My video content is protected by copyright:

✓ Original creative expression
✓ Audiovisual work fixed in tangible form
✓ Not consisting of unprotectable elements

**Elements Protected:**
- [ ] Video footage I filmed/created
- [ ] Audio/music I composed/performed
- [ ] Editing/compilation I created
- [ ] Visual effects I added
- [ ] Choreography/performance I created
- [ ] Script/narration I wrote

Justification: {{copyrightability_explanation}}

**B. Fair Use Analysis - YouTube Context**

I have carefully considered whether this use constitutes fair use, especially given YouTube's community of commentary, review, and educational content:

**Factor 1 - Purpose and Character:**

Is the use transformative?
- [ ] No - it's a straight re-upload
- [ ] No - minor edits don't make it transformative
- [ ] Minimal commentary is insufficient to justify entire video use
- [ ] Commercial purpose (monetized video)

Does it add new expression or meaning?
{{transformation_analysis}}

YouTube-specific consideration:
- [ ] Not a review, reaction, or critique with fair use merit
- [ ] Not educational use with limited clips
- [ ] Not parody or commentary
- [ ] Simply reproduces my work for same purpose

Conclusion: {{purpose_conclusion}}

**Factor 2 - Nature of Work:**
My work is:
- [ ] Highly creative entertainment content
- [ ] Published on YouTube
- [ ] Deserving strong copyright protection

Conclusion: {{nature_conclusion}}

**Factor 3 - Amount Used:**
The infringing video uses:
- [ ] My entire video
- [ ] Substantial heart/core of my video
- [ ] Amount exceeds what's necessary for claimed purpose

Even if labeled "review" or "reaction":
- Using my complete video goes beyond fair use
- Could have used brief clips instead
- Amount used is unreasonable

Conclusion: {{amount_conclusion}}

**Factor 4 - Market Effect:**
This video:
- [ ] Substitutes for watching my original
- [ ] Reduces views/engagement on my video
- [ ] Harms my monetization potential
- [ ] Competes directly with my content

For YouTube specifically:
- Viewers may watch this instead of my video
- Algorithm may favor infringing video
- My ad revenue is harmed

Conclusion: {{market_conclusion}}

**OVERALL FAIR USE DETERMINATION:**

After analyzing all four factors in the YouTube context, I have determined in good faith that this does NOT constitute fair use.

**Key Reasons:**
{{fair_use_key_reasons}}
