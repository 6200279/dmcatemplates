**Financial Impact:**

- Infringer's price: ${{infringer_price}}
- Estimated sales of infringing items: {{estimated_sales}}
- My lost revenue (estimated): ${{lost_revenue}}

**Market Confusion:**
- [ ] Buyers may think infringer is affiliated with me
- [ ] Lower quality products damage my reputation

- [ ] Search results show infringer before my shop

**SECTION 7: ETSY SEARCH/SEO IMPACT**

- [ ] Infringing listings use my trademark in tags/titles
- [ ] Infringing listings redirect potential customers from my shop
- [ ] Multiple infringing listings dilute my brand presence

Search terms affected: {{affected_search_terms}}

**SECTION 8: PRE-FILING ASSESSMENT**

**A. Copyrightability Assessment**

I have verified that my work is protected by copyright:

✓ Original creative work
✓ Fixed in tangible medium (digital files, physical products)
✓ Not consisting solely of unprotectable elements

**Specific Copyrightability:**
- [ ] Original artistic expression in design
- [ ] Creative arrangement/composition
- [ ] Original illustration/artwork
- [ ] Original photography
- [ ] Original graphic design elements
- [ ] Original pattern/textile design
- [ ] Original text/writing

**Not Claiming Copyright In:**
- [ ] Common geometric shapes (if any)
- [ ] Standard fonts (if any)
- [ ] Generic design elements
- [ ] Functional aspects

What IS protected: {{protected_elements}}

Justification: {{copyrightability_explanation}}

**B. Fair Use Analysis**

I have considered whether the infringing Etsy listings constitute fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107:

**Factor 1 - Purpose and Character of Use:**

The infringing shop's use is:
- [ ] Not transformative - direct reproduction for commercial sale
- [ ] Commercial purpose - selling products for profit
- [ ] No commentary, criticism, or new expression added
- [ ] Merely copies my design onto products for resale

Analysis: {{purpose_analysis}}

Etsy marketplace context:
- This is straightforward commercial exploitation
- No transformative purpose (not parody, commentary, or criticism)
- Simply reproducing my work to profit from my creativity
- Competes directly with my own sales

Conclusion: {{purpose_conclusion}}

**Factor 2 - Nature of Copyrighted Work:**

My work is:
- [ ] Highly creative artistic expression
- [ ] Original design created by me
- [ ] Published (available for purchase/viewing)
- [ ] Deserving strong copyright protection

Analysis: {{nature_analysis}}
Conclusion: {{nature_conclusion}}

**Factor 3 - Amount and Substantiality Used:**

The infringing listings use:
- [ ] My entire design/artwork
- [ ] The heart of my creative expression
- [ ] Not excerpts or portions - complete reproduction
- [ ] Quality: [ ] Identical [ ] Lower quality reproduction

Analysis: {{amount_analysis}}

Could they have used less?
- They could have created their own original design
- No legitimate reason to use my complete work
- Amount used far exceeds any conceivable fair use purpose

Conclusion: {{amount_conclusion}}

**Factor 4 - Effect on Potential Market:**

The infringing sales:
- [ ] Directly compete with my Etsy shop/sales
- [ ] Substitute for purchasing from me
- [ ] Undercut my pricing with unauthorized versions
- [ ] Cause direct economic harm: ${{estimated_harm}}
- [ ] Reduce my visibility in Etsy search results
- [ ] Harm my licensing opportunities

Analysis: {{market_analysis}}

**Etsy-Specific Market Harm:**
- Buyers searching for this design may buy from infringer instead
- Lower prices undercut my legitimate sales
- Multiple infringing listings dilute my brand
- Damages reputation if inferior quality

Conclusion: {{market_conclusion}}

**OVERALL FAIR USE DETERMINATION:**

After evaluating all four statutory factors, I have determined in good faith that the reported Etsy listings do NOT constitute fair use. This is unauthorized commercial reproduction of my copyrighted work for profit in direct competition with my own sales.

**Key Reasons:**
1. Commercial exploitation without transformation
2. Uses my complete original work
3. Direct market substitution causing economic harm
4. No legitimate fair use purpose (not commentary, criticism, education, etc.)

**SECTION 9: ETSY POLICY VIOLATIONS**

This also violates Etsy's:
- [ ] Intellectual Property Policy
- [ ] Handmade Policy (if claiming handmade when reproducing my work)
- [ ] Prohibited Items Policy
- [ ] Seller Policy regarding original content
- [ ] Community Guidelines regarding respect for others' work

**SECTION 10: NOT A TRADEMARK ISSUE**

- [ ] This is a COPYRIGHT claim, not trademark
- [ ] I am not claiming trademark infringement (file separately if applicable)
- [ ] This is about unauthorized reproduction of my artistic work
- [ ] Copyright protection applies even without trademark registration

**If BOTH copyright and trademark apply:**
- [ ] I am filing separate trademark complaint
- [ ] This notice addresses copyright only

**SECTION 11: REQUIRED LEGAL STATEMENTS**

**Good Faith Belief Statement:**
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material described above in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

**Accuracy Declaration:**
The information in this notification is accurate.

**Authorization Under Penalty of Perjury:**
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**SECTION 12: REQUESTED ACTIONS**

I request that Etsy:

1. ✓ Remove all identified infringing listings immediately
2. ✓ Notify the shop owner(s) about the removal
3. ✓ Apply intellectual property strikes per Etsy policy
4. ✓ Consider shop suspension if repeat offender
5. ✓ Prevent re-listing of infringing items
6. ✓ Provide removal confirmation to me
7. ✓ [Optional] Share seller contact information if legally permissible

**For Systematic Infringement:**
- [ ] Shop appears dedicated to selling unauthorized reproductions
- [ ] Request permanent shop closure
- [ ] Seller has multiple shops selling same infringing items

**SECTION 13: ETSY REPEAT INFRINGER POLICY**

- [ ] This seller has been subject to previous IP complaints
- Previous complaints: {{previous_complaint_count}}
- Dates: {{previous_complaint_dates}}
- Seller continues to list infringing items despite removals

This demonstrates repeat infringer status warranting stronger action.
