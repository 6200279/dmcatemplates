**A. Copyrightability**

My works are protected by copyright:
✓ Original creative works
✓ Fixed in tangible medium
✓ Not public domain or unprotectable

Specific copyrightability:
{{copyrightability_explanation}}

**B. Fair Use Analysis**

**Purpose:** BitTorrent distribution is not transformative - it's verbatim copying for mass distribution without any fair use purpose.

**Nature:** My works are creative works entitled to strong protection.

**Amount:** Complete works are shared via torrents, not excerpts.

**Market Effect:** Torrent distribution directly substitutes for authorized sales, causing severe market harm by providing free alternative to purchasing.

**DETERMINATION:** This is NOT fair use - it is mass piracy causing substantial economic harm.

**SECTION 9: TORRENT PROTOCOL CONSIDERATIONS**

I understand that:
- Torrent sites index .torrent files and magnet links
- Actual file transfer occurs peer-to-peer between users
- Sites facilitate but don't host the infringing files
- Removal of torrent listings reduces ability to find files

However, 17 U.S.C. § 512 requires removal of listings that link to infringing material.

**SECTION 10: REQUIRED LEGAL STATEMENTS**

**Good Faith Belief:**
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material in the manner complained of (distribution via BitTorrent) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

**Accuracy Declaration:**
The information in this notification is accurate.

**Authorization Under Penalty of Perjury:**
Under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**SECTION 11: REQUESTED ACTIONS**

1. ✓ **Remove torrent listings** from the site
